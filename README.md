## The app 
the app was programmed using laravel, which means in a MVC Model, at first it may seem confusing, but the Model shines when you start to have a lot of pages or code. Since everything is organized.
The problems we faced, was how at the start it was hard to connect a database.db, when we changed it to database.sqlite the migrations worked.
The other problem is Crud, which we stragelled with.
